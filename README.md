This is a 3D spinning pyramid in OpenGL using C++.

For the first time ever in this portfolio, I did NOT code this myself. This is code that someone brilliant made, and it was retrieved from the web. I just changed it around a little bit. Getting the environment set up was no small task, and I got to play around and change a lot of things along the way to experiment. Learned about views, translations, projection, etc. It's not the first time anybody copied code and changed it.

I had a choice of using Microsoft DirectX or OpenGL to do this, and I found out that the RAGE Gaming Engine from Rockstar Games uses OpenGL (games like Grand Theft Auto & Red Dead Redemption). I also found out that the Blender 3D Modeling software is made from OpenGL, so with those two getting that endorsement, the choice of OpenGL/C++ was easy.

I have always want to keep my coding skills sharp and to explore new frontiers in my coding life, and to show many of my friends who don't understand the merits & fun that coding & ordering around the computer brings.

I have always loved the "low levels" of coding like C++ & Rust, and believe that they help with the more abstracted languages like Python & JavaScript that are used in production.

If I ever decide to make cool graphics or maybe Supernova simulations, this would be the starting point.

Don't mind how the pyramid looks in the GIF. GIF doesn't allow all colors.
